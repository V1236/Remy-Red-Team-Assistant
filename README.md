# Remy-Red-Team-Assistant
Remy is an AI assistant for pentest/red-teaming. They can be interacted with like any regular chat bot, ask questions give commands, etc.
Remy watches a log file (natively VforMSF.log) saving any important data that comes through the log, such as CVE's, open ports, subdomains, endpoints, etc for your review.

Remy was made as an assistant for https://github.com/V1236/VforMSF but, with some changes, can be useful independently.

If running by itself, the Start_VforMSF.sh needs to be edited so that it begns logging a different script than "python3 VforMSF.py". You could have it log a bash terminal by simply replacing "python3 VforMSF.py" with "bash".

Also it utilizes an openai API key so insert your own key in the place that calls for it, if you want full functionality.

Usage:

'''
python3 assistant.py
'''
